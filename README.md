# Kaiyuan Liu's GitHub

Welcome to my GitHub! I am a **M.Sc. student in Data Science** at the **University of Macau**, focusing on **Artificial Intelligence Applications**. My research interests include **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **On-Device Inference**, **Edge Computing**, and **Machine Learning Systems (MLSys)**. I am passionate about developing solutions that optimize real-time LLM inference on edge devices.

## 📚 Research

I work on bridging the gap between **high-performance AI systems** and **resource-constrained environments**, such as mobile and edge devices. Below are some of my recent publications:

### [RTSS’25, CCF-A] HCInfer: Hierarchical Coordination for Real-Time Collaborative Inference of LLM on the Edge
*Kaiyuan Liu, Lizi Zhang, Chengzhong Xu, Li Li*  
This paper introduces **HCInfer**, a framework that utilizes hierarchical coordination between edge devices to optimize **LLM inference** in real-time applications.

### [TPDS’25, CCF-A] m2LLM: A Multi-Dimensional Optimization Framework for LLM Inference on Mobile Devices
*Kaiyuan Liu, Xiaobo Zhou, Li Li*  
In this work, we propose **m2LLM**, a multi-dimensional optimization framework that reduces the memory footprint and inference latency for **LLMs** on mobile devices.

## 🧑‍💻 Research Experience

### **Edge LLM Collaborative Inference Framework**  
*University of Macau, Jan. 2025 – May. 2025*  
This project focuses on developing a **collaborative inference framework** using idle neighboring devices to address **memory and compute constraints** in edge-device LLM deployment. We employ two-level optimization: **inter-device coordination** and **intra-device resource utilization**.

### **LLM Inference on Mobile Devices**  
*University of Macau, Jun. 2024 – Dec. 2024*  
I am investigating ways to optimize **LLM inference** on mobile devices, addressing issues like high energy consumption and long inference times. The framework incorporates **multi-dimensional optimization** to balance performance, real-time efficiency, and energy consumption.

### **Chinese Sign Language Recognition Project**  
*Henan University, Apr. 2021 – May. 2022*  
I led the development of a **Chinese Sign Language recognition model** that achieved 88% accuracy for 300 signs. This project won the **National Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training** award and contributed to one software copyright.
